   Abstract = {CRONOS is a suite of numerical codes for the predictive/interpretative simulation of a full tokamak discharge. It integrates, in a modular structure, a 1D transport solver with general 2D magnetic equilibria, several heat, particle and impurities transport models, as well as heat, particle and momentum sources. This paper gives a first comprehensive description of the CRONOS suite: overall structure of the code, main available models, details on the simulation workflow and numerical implementation. Some examples of applications to the analysis of experimental discharges and the predictions of ITER scenarios are also given.},

   Journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
   Volume = {53},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {033002},
   Abstract = {The coupled system consisting of 1D radial transport equations and the quasi-static 2D magnetic equilibrium equation for axisymmetric systems (tokamaks) is known to be prone to numerical instabilities, either due to propagation of numerical errors in the iteration process, or due to the choice of the numerical scheme itself. In this paper, a possible origin of these instabilities, specifically associated with the latter condition, is discussed and an approach is chosen, which is shown to have good accuracy and stability properties. This scheme is proposed to be used within those codes for which the poloidal flux psi is the quantity solved for in the current diffusion equation. Mathematical arguments are used to study the convergence properties of the proposed scheme.},
