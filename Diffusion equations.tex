\section{Diffusion equations in tokamak}

On the diffusion time scale, the (perpendicular) transport in an axisymmetric tokamak can be described by flux-surface averaged diffusion equations.

\[\frac{{\partial y}}{{\partial t}} - \frac{\partial }{{\partial x}}D\frac{{\partial y}}{{\partial x}} = {S_y}\]
